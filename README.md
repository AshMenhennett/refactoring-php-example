# Refactoring - PHP Edition

This repository contains the same code examples of Martin Fowler's Refactoring book, but written in PHP.
It was used as companion for the talk [Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://speakerdeck.com/mehlah/refactoring-improving-the-design-of-existing-code)

You can follow the refactoring steps taken, in each branch, starting from [`1-decompose-statement`](https://github.com/craftsmen/refactoring-php-example/tree/1-decompose-statement)
